# Project Rationale
Aside from the potential for financial benefits and wealth building, the stock market presents hurdles and barriers to investors. Stock prices’ intrinsic volatility and unpredictability, impacted by a variety of factors such as economic conditions, geopolitical events, industry trends, and investor opinion, produce uncertainty and a perception of high risk (Sari et al., 2022). The complexity of stock markets and the availability of information might overwhelm potential investors, resulting in a lack of perceived understanding and the fear of making erroneous decisions and incurring financial losses.

The issues being looked at here include:
•	Volatility and uncertainty
•	Lack of knowledge and information overload	
 

# Project Aim
The aim of this project is to leverage business intelligence and analytic tools in addressing issues of market volatility, accessibility, and uncertainty in the stock market, with a focus area on the FTSE 100. The goal of the project is to give data-driven insights as it relates to investing in the stock market to enable users to make informed decisions and improve investment performance for investors. 

# Research Questions
