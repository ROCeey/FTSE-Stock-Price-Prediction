# Project Rationale
Aside from the potential for financial benefits and wealth building, the stock market presents hurdles and barriers to investors. Stock pricesâ€™ intrinsic volatility and unpredictability, impacted by a variety of factors such as economic conditions, geopolitical events, industry trends, and investor opinion, produce uncertainty and a perception of high risk (Sari et al., 2022). The complexity of stock markets and the availability of information might overwhelm potential investors, resulting in a lack of perceived understanding and the fear of making erroneous decisions and incurring financial losses.

The issues being looked at here include:
* Volatility and uncertainty
* Lack of knowledge and information overload	
 

# Project Aim
The aim of this project is to leverage business intelligence and analytic tools in addressing issues of market volatility, accessibility, and uncertainty in the stock market, with a focus area on the FTSE 100. The goal of the project is to give data-driven insights as it relates to investing in the stock market to enable users to make informed decisions and improve investment performance for investors. 

# Project Questions
The foundation of this project is based on the following questions, which focus is to evaluate the use of business intelligence and analytics in predicting the stock market trends of FTSE 100.  They include:

1.	What are the factors that influence the daily closing price of the FTSE100 index
2.	How accurate is the use of business intelligence and analytics techniques in predicting the stock market FTSE 100?
3.	What insights can be gotten effectively by exploiting the user-friendly interface and data visualization dashboard to incorporate data-driven insights into their stock market investing decision-making process by individuals and investors?

# Project scope
This study will focus on the FTSE 100 as a major market index.  In terms of market capitalization, the London Stock Exchange according to Michie (2001) has played a significant role and has influenced the way in which people trade their securities both internationally and globally. Over 100 businesses have their securities listed on the London Stock Exchange, with the benefit of having exposure and expected returns.  The stock index in addition to being a benchmark for analysing the success of the United Kingdom, it can also serve as a point of reference for financial products and investment strategies. 
Over the years, it is evident that the FTSE 100 has provided a high dividend yield as many companies have a history of paying dividends, and good standing as well as making them appeal to income investors. Like every other market, the FTSE 100 is susceptible to volatility and can fluctuate due to a variety of variables such as macroeconomic statistics, interest rates, corporate earnings reports, political developments, market attitudes, and other business-related events. 

# Significance of project
The relevance of this study rests in its ability to address significant issues and provide valuable insights in the field of stock market investment. The project attempts to simplify complex financial information and empower investors to make informed investment decisions by leveraging business intelligence (BI) technologies and tools. The creation of a user-friendly interface and data visualisation dashboard can increase data comprehension and make stock market information more accessible to a wider audience.
